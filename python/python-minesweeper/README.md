PySweeper!!!
============

That's right... a command-line implementation of MineSweeper in Python... using emoji!

It's my first "serious" Python project (and it probably shows)

Requirements
============
1. a terminal
2. python 3.9 or 3.10
3. Python's colorama and emoji modules


Playing the game
================
$ python game.py --rows ?? --cols ?? --mines ??

Make it as hard or as easy as you want with the following limitations:
- There MUST be at least 1 cell in the board that does not contain a mine
- The board is limited to (at most) slightly smaller than your terminal window... or 36 rows and columns... which ever is smaller
